# Dog-breed-classifier
A CNN based algorithm that either predicts the dog breed in the image or predicts the dog breed most resembling the human in the image
This repository contains:
1) An iPython notebook detailing how the CNN model was built and how the predictions were made
2) An HTML file which is the output of the iPython notebook
3) Some of the external images used for testing apart from the ones in the dog breed image database
